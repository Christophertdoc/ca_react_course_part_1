/*
JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

That means that a JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array...you name it.

Here's an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable:

var navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;
Here's an example of several JSX elements being stored in an object:

var Pistons2004 = {
  center:        <li>Ben Wallace</li>,
  powerForward:  <li>Rasheed Wallace</li>,
  smallForward:  <li>Tayshaun Prince</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Richard Hamilton</li>,
  pointGuard:    <li>Chauncey Billups</li>
};
Instructions
1.
